# Creating my personal website with nuxt

Welcome to my first blog post using the content module offered by nuxt ! In this post I'll describe my first real experience with Nuxt.

## The project

First, the project. My project was something I had in mind for a long time, but never managed to find the time to do : a simple personal website to gain visibility on the web and show a bit of what I do. The confinement in France had one positive impact on me : I got started with this project. I had a rough idea of what I wanted in this website : a resume of what my work experiences and skills ; a list of way to contact me and a blog section where I could start writing.

## Why Nuxt ?  

One thing to know about me is I love front end development. I already have a bit of real world experiences with Angular and React, so I wanted to try Vue on a real project which goes a bit beyond classical tutorials (big fan of learn by doing). At the same time, I knew I wasn't good enough with Vue to create alone a 
whole project structure from scratch (and not regret it later at least). And here come Nuxt and the very first advantage I saw in this framework. Starting a project with Nuxt is very simple and it takes care for you of the pain of all the set up pain. It allowed me to focus on developing and creating content from the get-go. I also knew a bit about what Nuxt opinions and features were so I knew I could make my project with it.

## Feedback on ?  

Now that we know why Nuxt, it's time to dive into what I used in Nuxt. Keep in mind it's opiniated list of some of the main stuff I used. Nuxt is much richer than just that.

### Dynamic routing  

<br/>

Do you remember php ? Yes I just said php, please do not be afraid. Nuxt proposes a routing system very similar to what php proposed : based of file names and directory structures. Everything starts with the *pages* directory. Inside, you will place your pages (no kidding). By pages, I mean Vue components linked to a route. But how do I define these routes ? You don't ! When Nuxt builds your project, it looks at the files inside your *pages* directory and generate it for you, based on the names you gave to your files.
