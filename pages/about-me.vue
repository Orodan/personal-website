        My story started in Bangladesh, a small country in South Asia with
        massive potential. From my childhood, I was fascinated by science and
        math. This fascination brought me to study engineering in the best
        engineering institution in Bangladesh, BUET.

        After graduation, I first worked as a pre-sales engineer at Huawei. In
        that position, I had to communicate with all levels of customers. Some
        of my customers had years of technical experience. They were concerned
        with the minute technical details of the solutions. At the same time,
        CXO level customers were more concerned with the business impact. These
        experiences let me develop my technical and non-technical abilities
        simultaneously.

        Following that, I switched over to a more sales-oriented role at ZTE.
        There, I got the opportunity to work on IV-Tier Data Center project
        (near USD 200M). This project had lots of moving parts, which required
        constant monitoring. Due to the size of the project, my impact was
        nominal. However, it was a humbling experience.

        Now I am studying for MEng at the Information Systems Security at
        Concordia University. While this may seem unconventional (following my
        experience), it's a continuation of my enthusiasm for Cloud Computing
        and Networks. In addition to academics, I have experience with AWS and
        GCP. I am an AWS Certified Cloud Solution Architect - Associate and
        Google Cloud Certified Associate Cloud Engineer.
