      Hi, I’m Jimmy. I’m an French software engineer living and working in
      Nantes, France.
      <br />
      I'm also a trainer and I love sharing my passion for software development
      with people in many ways like writing blogs and speaking at meetups and
      conferences.

        My story started in the beautiful city of La Rochelle. I joined the
        computer science university where I studied for five years to get my
        master degree. In the last two years, I had the chance to be an
        apprentice in the information system management of my university.

      <div class="story-content bg-blue white">
        After getting my master degree, I decided to leave La Rochelle and try
        my luck in Paris where I chose to join Zenika. I stayed for 2 years
        where I got to work for EDF, AFP and Saint-Gobain, meeting amazing
        people and developping my skills in web development, mostly on
        Javascript, Angular and Spring. I also became a trainer and gave
        formations on web topics.

      <div class="story-content blue">
        Finally, I moved from Paris to Nantes. Luckily Zenika already had an
        agency where I could continue my journey in. Since I got here, I've been
        working as a web developer for MMB where I learned React, graphql and so
        much more thanks to the people around me. And my journey keeps going
        until today in this beautiful city ...
